          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
            2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
            Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
            engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
            science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
            Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
            space programme and military missile development efforts. He thus
            came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
            development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
            technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

            mosque his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a ferry
            that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now 
            uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four
            brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors
            had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties 
            and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in 
            coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and 
            local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between 
            the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as 
            ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.
